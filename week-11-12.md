## Bi-Weekly Status Report      

### Status Report
##### Overall Status
On schedule

##### Summary of Project tasking

My task was to code the fuse class G. I also met with the project manager to get a better understanding of the code requirements. Then met with my team to share what I learned from that meeting.

###### Meetings/Training
Team Meeting: 1 hour

Project manager meeting: 1.5 hours

---

### Notes
#### Team 3 Code Requirements

##### Component Requirements
###### Set Icon in super
```JavaScript
icon_path="../assets/component_icons/Fuse_Holder.svg"
```
###### set the components rules in constructor
Example:
```JavaScript
this.blow_type = "Fast-acting";
this.current_rating = {
        min: 0,
        max: 60
      };
```

##### Methods required for each component 

* set_data (might be different name)
* update_self
* get_data_display
  * data that will be displayed for user
  * create JSON and add all attributes
  * only components specified rules not all the data
* get_data_raw
  * returns all data even if not used in the class
  * all data from the parent class (Component)
* add methods that verify UL rules
  * These are extra methods unique to every component. Name them whatever makes sense, they will not be pre-existing methods in Component.js like the get_data_raw() method.
  * call these methods in the update_self() 
 
##### Testing
Every component and its rules need to be tested. This is done in the script_test.html file. 

Take screenshots of test results and add them to the Google doc.

##### Common ErrorsNeed a new way to get display data

`JSON.stringify(this)` doesn't work. Gets circular reference error.

###### Import class wrong
Not including ".js". Will show a 403 error in console in browser.

*Correct*
```JavaScript
import { Fuse } from "./Fuse.js";
```

*Wrong*
```JavaScript
import { Fuse } from "./Fuse";
```

##### CADDIEngine

The CADDIEngine is the user interface. Each component needs to be added to it. 

###### Import component into CADDIEngine class

###### Add to dropdown list
Add to supported_components object near line 77 in CADDIEngine.js

Example:
```JavaScript
"Fuse Class G": ClassG,
```
