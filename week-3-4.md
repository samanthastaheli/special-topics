##### Summary
This week we learned about configuration management and version control. Configuration management is a process that is used to develop software with consistency. When multiple people are working on a program, they need to be on the same page and not overwrite someone else's code. In GitHub this is managed through branches and pull requests. Branches are used when multiple people need to write code in the same file. You cannot see your team's code live, so every team member creates a branch where they are free to add code. When a team member's code is done they submit a pull request. Team managers then look at the pull request and solve any conflict that appears.

My team's task is adding distribution blocks to the web app. Since none of my team members know what distribution blocks are we did not have any specifically assigned stories.
