# Week 5-6

## Notes

### Test Driven Development
#### Unit test: 
* automated test
* when change is made in code, needs to ensure it doesn't mess up so have test that can pass or fail

#### When adding new feature to code
1. write new test for feature, that will fail because the function has not ban added yet
2. code new fentime, will pass test
3. refactor to make code a good design

##### 4 Principles Associated with TDD and Unit Testing

##### What advantages as a developer does TDD provide?
TDD allows developers to find errors in their code faster. When a test is written for each new feature developers find errors right away, rather than finding errors after adding lots of features.

##### What steps do I do to implement TDD?
1. prefix: ID
   * Unique id
2. description / Summary
   * includes story, workflow
   * why are testing feature?
3. prerequisites
   * what needs to be running
   * What needs to happen before test
   * Examples: server, database
4. category/component
5. author/point of contact (POC)
6. requirement/story
   * How tied to requirement, design, or story
   * Why does it need to exist? 
7. Test Steps:
   1. Action - what muds to happen
   2. Results/Verify
      * Result of action
      * Ex: window, some state
      * Verify that actions verified the feature
   3. Pass/ Fail
      * Indicate whether the test passed or failed

###### Test Plan Formats:
- table
- text doc
- Spreadsheet

##### What tools or software can I use to do unit testing?
* Katalon Recorder
  * can covert to code

#### TDD vs BDD

| Test Driven Design | Behavior Driven Design |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Developer Implementation | Team Implementation |
| Uses programming language | Uses natural language (test plan) |
| white box testing | black box testing |
| scope is test functions | scope is test end-to-end |

###### White Box Testing

###### Black Box Testing
